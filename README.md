White text on black paper, while visually striking, is rarely used for traditional books, documents, or standard paper formats. Historically, printed materials have predominantly used dark ink on light-colored paper for readability and production ease. The primary reason lies in legibility; dark ink on light paper aligns with how our eyes process light and contrast, making it comfortable for prolonged reading. This high legibility standard established by centuries of printing practices set the precedent for nearly all types of print media.

One practical reason white on black paper isn’t widely used is the printing process itself. Black ink absorbs light and reflects minimal glare, making it cheaper and simpler to print than large blocks of white ink. White ink requires different printing technology, often involving specialized opaque inks or complex printing techniques that increase production costs. For mass-produced books or standard documents, this would not only increase costs but also complicate production, as traditional printing presses are optimized for dark ink on light paper.

White text on black also poses issues with readability over long periods. Human eyes are generally more comfortable interpreting dark shapes on a light background due to natural light perception and how our visual system detects contrast. When reversed, particularly with small fonts or fine text, the contrast becomes too intense, causing text to “bleed” or appear blurry. This visual strain makes reading white on black more challenging for extended periods, which is why novels, textbooks, and other long-form print media avoid this format.

Another consideration is the psychological effect of color and contrast in print materials. Black text on white is often associated with clarity and professionalism, likely because it is a long-established convention. White on black can feel unconventional or less approachable, sometimes associated more with digital displays or graphic design rather than traditional reading materials. As a result, books and standard documents maintain the black-on-white format to create a sense of familiarity, formality, and ease.

White on black has found a place in modern contexts, such as digital screens, where backlit displays make the format more comfortable for short bursts of reading, especially in low-light environments. In print, however, it remains limited to specific design choices, such as art books, posters, or attention-grabbing advertisements. The shift to digital reading has renewed interest in dark themes, but for physical books or standard paper documents, white text on black remains the exception due to cost, readability, and the established norms of print culture.

### Ambient Light

The ambient light in a room affects how we perceive both paper and monitor displays differently due to the way each surface interacts with light. Paper is a reflective medium, meaning it relies on external light sources to be readable. In a well-lit environment, paper is easy to read because light reflects off the surface and reaches our eyes evenly, providing a natural and consistent viewing experience. However, in dim lighting, reading from paper becomes challenging without an external light source. This dependency on ambient light makes printed materials more versatile in bright environments but less adaptable in low-light conditions.

Monitors, on the other hand, are emissive sources, meaning they generate their own light, which allows them to be viewed in both low-light and dark environments without additional light sources. However, in bright ambient light, especially sunlight, screens can become harder to read due to glare and reflections, as well as the washed-out appearance of colors. Monitors can adjust their brightness levels to compensate for changes in ambient light, but this often comes at the cost of eye strain, particularly in dark environments where a bright screen can be harsh. The ambient light level, therefore, plays a crucial role in the comfort and readability of both paper and digital screens, with paper performing better in well-lit environments and screens having an advantage in low-light settings.

### Dark Mode Coding

On computer monitors, using white text on a dark background has become popular, especially in programming and development environments. Known as “dark mode,” this approach is favored because it reduces the amount of light emitted from the screen, which can help reduce eye strain, especially in low-light environments where bright screens can be uncomfortable. For programmers, who often spend hours staring at code, a dark background with light text can make it easier to focus and lessen the visual fatigue that comes from long periods of screen exposure. Additionally, many developers find that syntax highlighting (where keywords, variables, and other code elements are displayed in different colors) is often easier to distinguish against a dark background, helping to improve code readability and speed up debugging.

Another reason dark backgrounds with light text are popular among programmers is that they can reduce glare and are perceived as more energy-efficient on certain displays, particularly OLED screens. With OLED, darker pixels require less power, so dark mode can contribute to battery savings on portable devices. While dark backgrounds are not universally preferred—some people still find light backgrounds more comfortable for readability—the option to switch to a dark theme has become standard in most code editors and development environments. This trend reflects a shift toward customizable interfaces that prioritize user comfort and reduce strain, particularly for tasks that require intense concentration, like programming.

### Optimal Text-Background Contrast

| Background Color     | Text Color       | Medium       | Best Use Case               | Benefits                                         |
|----------------------|------------------|--------------|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| White (#FFFFFF)      | Black (#000000)  | Print, Screen| Bright environments         | High contrast, traditional readability for long-form text |
| Light Gray (#F5F5F5) | Dark Gray (#333333) | Screen    | Neutral lighting            | Softer contrast, easier on the eyes for prolonged reading |
| Black (#000000)      | White (#FFFFFF)  | Screen       | Low-light or night mode     | Reduces glare, good for dark mode settings       |
| Dark Gray (#1E1E1E)  | Light Gray (#D3D3D3) | Screen | Low-light environments       | Reduces eye strain, commonly used in IDEs and text editors |
| Dark Blue (#1A1A40)  | Light Yellow (#FFFFB3) | Screen | Coding and design work       | Helps with focus, especially with syntax highlighting |
| Navy Blue (#001F3F)  | Light Cyan (#E0FFFF)  | Screen | Night mode for displays      | Reduces blue light strain, provides contrast without harshness |
| Dark Green (#003300) | Light Green (#CCFFCC) | Screen | Relaxed ambient lighting     | Soothing for long reading, reduces harsh contrast |
| Sepia (#F5E6C4)      | Dark Brown (#5D4037) | Print       | Low to moderate lighting     | Mimics printed paper, reduces eye strain for reading |
| Dark Purple (#2D1B4A)| Light Pink (#FFD1DC) | Screen      | Low-light creative settings  | Gentle on the eyes, adds color variety without high contrast |
